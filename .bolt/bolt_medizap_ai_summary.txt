Our conversation has focused on developing the MediZap AI clinic management system. Here's a summary of our progress:

Initial Setup & UI Preferences: We established the project's foundation, emphasizing a production-worthy design using React, Tailwind CSS, and Lucide React for UI components.
Routing and New Pages: We implemented routing and created dedicated pages for "Appointments" and "Doctors" to manage clinic data.
Doctor Management Enhancements:
We modified the "Add Doctor" form, initially removing email and specialization fields.
A feature was added to allow users to create new departments directly from the doctor form.
We addressed an issue where newly added departments were not immediately visible in the dropdown list.
Specialization and Department Synchronization:
A key clarification was made regarding the doctor's specialization: instead of removing the specialization column, you wanted it to automatically reflect the selected department's name.
To achieve this, we restored the specialization column in the doctors table and implemented a database trigger (sync_doctor_specialization). This trigger automatically populates and updates the specialization field with the department.name whenever a doctor is added or their department is changed. This ensures data consistency and simplifies the doctor creation process.
